Create the vehicles package, which will contain the Car and ElectricCar classes, and the app package, which will contain the main class with the main method. Add the private fields owner Name and insurance Number to the Car class. Create access methods (getters and setters) for the owner Name and insurance Number fields. Add the engine Type field with the protected access modifier and create access methods for this field.
Task #2
Create a new Electric Car class that inherits the Car class and add the battery Capacity field to it. In the Electric Car class, use the engine Type field to set the engine type as "Electric".
