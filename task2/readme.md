Task #1
Write a program that creates a Car class. The following fields should be indicated in this class: String model, String license, String color, int year â€“ car model, car number, car color and year of manufacture, respectively. The class must contain three constructors, one constructor that includes all the fields of the class, one default constructor, and one includes fields of the student's choice.

Task #2
In a separate Main class, create class instances (objects) using the various constructors implemented in task #1. Create a To_String() method in the class that outputs the values of the class instances' fields. Check the operation of the created method by calling it on the object. Add methods to the class to get and set values for all fields (getters and setters). Create a class method that will return the age of the car, calculated from the current year, the value of the current year is allowed to become constant.
